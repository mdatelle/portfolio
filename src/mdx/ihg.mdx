- Developed the front end for an intranet based web application called Hotel Solutions.

- Created hand coded templates from design comps using HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript and XSL.

- Used jQuery and AJAX to enhance forms and other interactive page elements to create a more intuitive end user experience.

- Developed XSL templates used to produce dynamic pages based on data stored in XML. The XML was generated by a business intelligence application called Endeca, which received an XQuery based on user input.

- Worked very close with Java developers to help implement the XSL files into an open source portal application called Liferay.

- Designed new page mockups using Photoshop that were based on business requirements from internal clients.
